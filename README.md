# RedQueen2

This is a repository to support a research paper:

Žliobaitė, I. and Fortelius, M. (2020). All sizes fit the Red Queen. Paleobiology. Accepted.

For reproducing Figure 1 run script <code>run_Fig1.R</code>, for Figure 2 and Figure 3 run script <code>run_Fig23.R</code> (this takes a few hours to run on a commodity laptop, since there are 10000 randomized experiments to averagae over), for Figure A1 in the appendix run script <code>run_FigA1.R</code>. PDF figures are generated, each labelled by their number of appearance in the manuscript. Figure 3D does not appear in the final version of the manuscript, but I left it hear in case there is analytical interest. It is about biomass. 

The two csv files save the randomly generated data as a backup. For the near future the random seed will ensure that exactly the same figures as in the manuscript are reproduced. 

I'm happy to discuss any aspects of the Red Queen, always. Please e-mail.

Best regards,

Indrė
